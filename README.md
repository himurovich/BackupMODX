# BackupMODX
Backup Dashboard Widget for MODX CMS.

The BackupMODX extra is a tiny dashboard widget. Just place the widget into your dashboard and click the "Backup" button whenever you need a quick backup of your site. You can select either to backup your database, files or both. After the backup is finished you can download the files as a zip-archive. Just click the "Remove Backup" button after your download is finished to remove the backup.

The extra will backup all files and folders inside your MODX installation and will also include the core-folder if placed outside the web-root.

The widget is tested in different hosting environments and it works for our needs. If you have any problems/errors while using this extra - please let us know. If you also know how to enhance the extra/code - please feel free to contribute to the GitHub Repository.
